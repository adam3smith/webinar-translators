##Possible Translator Ideas

- [Polaris Library Cataloging System](https://github.com/zotero/translators/issues/657) (Difficult-ish: requires reading MARC into translator object)
- [Demographic Research](https://github.com/zotero/translators/issues/772) (RIS/Bibtex based)
- [WHO](https://github.com/zotero/translators/issues/791) (Screen Scraper. Not terribly hard but perhaps limited in quality)
- [Worldcat Discovery](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/37328/request-site-translator-for-worldcat-discovery-service/) (RIS based - may be a little tricky because of rampant Ajax on the site, but RIS looks stable)
